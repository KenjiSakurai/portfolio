                    I am a student who has always had a strong interest in tech and the Internet and I want to take part in the development of future technological advancements. I am calm, patient and collaborate well with others, which creates a good working environment. One thing that I think is important is structure and planning, but something even more important is being able to adapt to situations and problems and find new solutions and approaches. My greatest interest lies in creative work where I can focus fully on the task at hand. Another thing I value is working together with others as I always learn something new and develop my knowledge and experience.
